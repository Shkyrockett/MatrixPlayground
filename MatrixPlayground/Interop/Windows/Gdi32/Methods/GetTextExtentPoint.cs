            /// Because some devices kern characters, the sum of the extents of the characters in a string may not be equal to the extent of the string.
            /// The calculated string width takes into account the intercharacter spacing set by the SetTextCharacterExtra function and the justification set by SetTextJustification. This is true for both displaying on a screen and for printing. However, if lpDx is set in ExtTextOut, GetTextExtentPoint32 does not take into account either intercharacter spacing or justification. In addition, for EMF, the print result always takes both intercharacter spacing and justification into account.

            /// When this function returns the text extent, it assumes that the text is horizontal, that is, that the escapement is always 0. This is true for both the horizontal and vertical measurements of the text. Even if you use a font that specifies a nonzero escapement, this function doesn't use the angle while it computes the text extent. The app must convert it explicitly. However, when the graphics mode is set to GM_ADVANCED and the character orientation is 90 degrees from the print orientation, the values that this function return do not follow this rule. When the character orientation and the print orientation match for a given string, this function returns the dimensions of the string in the SIZE structure as { cx : 116, cy : 18 }. When the character orientation and the print orientation are 90 degrees apart for the same string, this function returns the dimensions of the string in the SIZE structure as { cx : 18, cy : 116 }.
