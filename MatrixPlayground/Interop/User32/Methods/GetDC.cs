        /// The GetDC function retrieves a common, class, or private DC depending on the class style of the specified window. For class and private DCs, GetDC leaves the previously assigned attributes unchanged. However, for common DCs, GetDC assigns default attributes to the DC each time it is retrieved. For example, the default font is System, which is a bitmap font. Because of this, the handle to a common DC returned by GetDC does not tell you what font, color, or brush was used when the window was drawn. To determine the font, call GetTextFace.
        /// Note that the handle to the DC can only be used by a single thread at any one time.
        /// After painting with a common DC, the ReleaseDC function must be called to release the DC. Class and private DCs do not have to be released. ReleaseDC must be called from the same thread that called GetDC. The number of DCs is limited only by available memory.
